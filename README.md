 Above python codes are provided to show the use of Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of survival in breast cancer patients using gene expression profiling. Machine learning techniques, such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and different feature selection techniques such as Lasso and recursice feature elimination are used to help in finding important genes that lead to breast cancer or help a patient to live longer . Therefore, the python codes describe the evaluation of different Machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors into two groups of high and low survival.
